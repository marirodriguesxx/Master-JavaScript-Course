# Section 01 Theory notes

## What is javascript?
### - javascript is a high-level object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language

## The role of javascript in web development
### HTML - visual content in the page
### CSS - style of the visual content
### javascript - build web aplications

## Usually javascript is attached to web pages

## console.log() function
### the console is just an enviroment to execute small pieces of codeand then show results immediately, but it doesent show results in code by default
### this function tell javaScript to explicity output that result to the console

## inline scripts:
### inline scripts are scripts that build the javaScript code inside the HTML file (example)
### the only advantage is that we don't have to load another file

## outline scripts:
### we have a bettert separation of concerns about what is presentation and what is logic
### its easier to  maintain code int he long run
### js and html connection is usually mande on the final of the body tag, using : "<script src = "pathToTheJavaScriptCode"></script>"

## Value is the smallest unit of information in javaScript, are usually stored in variables
### let variable = ßvalue
#### vale can be an integer. an string... etc

## javaScript variables 
### every value is either an object or a primitive value
### primitive data types : 
### - number: floating point numbers - always have decimals!
### - string: simply a sequence of characters
### - boolean: true or false? - logicalß type
### - undefined: when we not assign a value 
### - null: empßty value
### - symbol: value that is unique an cannot be changed
### - big int: integers that are too large

## when we declae a empty variable in javaScript, the variable value will be undefined, and also the type :)

## Dinamic typing in javaScript:
### we dont need to declary the type when we declare a variable
### javaScrit automatically determines the data type of a value when its stored into a variable
### in javaScript is the VALUE that has a type, not the variable
### we can assign a new to value with a different data type to the same varible without a problem

## typeof opearot: show the type of a value
